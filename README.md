I'm Esteban Casanova, Data Analyst with 3+ years of experience transforming raw data into actionable insights. I have experience with Data cleaning, extraction, ETL and ELT models, transformation and visualization. I'm always eager to learn more about Data and how can I improve with my Data recollection and transformation into information. I'm also a student, currently studying Data Science in the Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA) as I'm interested in gaining experience as Data Analyst, Data Engineer or Data Scientist. I also have knowledge with DevOps, with Linux, bash, Kubernetes and Docker.
